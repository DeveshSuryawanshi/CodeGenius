### Interview Simulator

- Our platform allows students to practice for interviews by engaging in realistic conversations with an AI interviewer, powered by the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/product#made-for-developers). If you're new to OpenAI API, you can get started [here](https://www.builder.io/blog/stream-ai-javascript).
- Users can choose the type of interview they want to practice, such as MERN, Node, or Java, and receive a series of relevant questions.
- The OpenAI API dynamically generates questions and provides appropriate responses based on student answers.
- The AI adapts its tone and style of questioning to simulate different interviewer behaviors, depending on the type of interview selected.
- We aim to provide a communicative interview experience by utilizing text-to-speech libraries, taking inspiration from the Masai VI platform.

### Personalized Feedback

- Our platform utilizes AI to analyze students' interview responses and offers constructive feedback.
- Feedback covers various aspects, including content, delivery, and overall performance of student answers.
- Strengths and areas for improvement are highlighted, such as communication skills, technical knowledge, or problem-solving abilities.

### User-Friendly Interface

- We prioritize a user-friendly web or mobile interface that is intuitive, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.
- Our goal is to ensure a seamless experience for users, allowing them to focus on interview preparation without encountering technical issues.
